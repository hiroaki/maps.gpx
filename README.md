# maps.gpx

The maps.gpx is a HTML5 application for overlay GPX on the Google Maps.

The main part of this project is `maps-gpx.js` JavaScript library
that provides each functions.
And HTML files are built by its several functions according to application.

Bundled `viewer.html` is one of example of application.
And there are other examples in `samples` directory.

Below is the description of the main JavaScript library `maps-gpx.js`.

## Usage

At first, load the Google Maps API with the geometory library.

And if it using the function which requires a GPS, set `sensor` to true.

Then load the `maps-gpx.js`. The class `MapsGPX` is defined by this.


```
<script src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true&libraries=geometry">
</script>
<script src="maps-gpx.js">
</script>
```

It is reasonable to begin applicatio after that waits a load of a document to be completed like general application.

Please use class method `onReady` for it.

After `load` of document waits for an event as well as all preparations of an after-mentioned plug-in have been completed, this guarantees to be called back.

Even if the document triggers `load` event,
there is a possibility that some of the function can't prepare yet.

```
MapsGPX.onReady(function (){
  // Logic of application should be written here.
});
```

To instantiate the class,
it accepts two parameters that are the same as `google.maps.Map` of Google Maps API.

The first argument is the ID for the viewport (DIV element) that should be drawn the map.

And the second argument gives [options](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference?hl=ja#MapOptions) by Hash,
it will be passed inside to constructor of `google.maps.Map` directly.
However, it is set the default value of `MapsGPX` if it is omitted.

```
<div id="map_canvas">
</div>
<script>
MapsGPX.onReady(function (){
  var app = new MapsGPX('map_canvas');
  // ...
});
</script>
```

Now a map is ready. Let's give GPX data to this map to overlay.

There are several ways to give GPX:

* String of GPX directly
* via binary of GPX (File or Blob object)
* via URL of GPX

The methods are prepared respectively.

* `addGPX`
* `input`

A method  `addGPX` is the lower-level input method from which a text of the contents of GPX is received.

On the other hand the higher-level input method  `input` is covering both of URL and Blob of GPX,
its contents of the object are passed to the method `addGPX`.

API is prepared for each, but part of user interface is left to developer.
However, it's possible to use the plug-in offered by external file instead of writing code.

* `Droppable`
* `QueryURL`

A plug-in `Droppable` passes the GPX object to method `input`,
by the user drags and drops GPX files on the map.

And A plug-in `QueryURL` also passes URL
which is the value of the parameter 'url' of the query string, to method `input`.

To use a plug-in, give its name to the instance method `use`.

```
app.use('Droppable');
app.use('QueryURL');
```

Specifically, please see examples described to below,
and build your application using the methods of instance, plug-ins and more things.


## Example 1

This example is using plug-in `Droppable`, which provides one of user interface.

This is an application that overlays waypoints and tracks as markers and polylines,
by you drag and drop GPX files into browser window.

And as the action when GPX was added:
- Fit the map so that all coordinates be contained in the viewport.
- Show all the waypoints and the tracks for adding GPX.

Like this example, when not directing specifically, overlays won't be shown.

It is possible to show/hide overlays anytime.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"><head><meta charset="UTF-8"/>
<title>maps.gpx</title>
<style>
html, body, #map_canvas { height: 100%; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; }
</style>
<script src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true&libraries=geometry"></script>
<script src="../maps-gpx.js"></script>
<script>
MapsGPX.onReady(function (){
  new MapsGPX('map_canvas')
  .use('Droppable')
  .register('onAddGPX', function(key) {
    this.fitBounds(key);
    this.showOverlayWpts(key);
    this.showOverlayTrks(key);
  });
});
</script>
</head><body>
  <div id="map_canvas"></div>
</body></html>
```


## Example 2

This example inputs GPX from URL.

In this case, it is useful when giving GPX as a parameter to a general-purpose map
on the page generated from a template in the CMS, Weblog and so on.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en"><head><meta charset="UTF-8"/>
<title>maps.gpx</title>
<style>
div.map { width:640px; height:320px; }
img.info-window { max-width: 200px; max-height: 200px; }
</style>
<script src="http://maps.google.com/maps/api/js?sensor=true&libraries=geometry"></script>
<script src="../maps-gpx.js"></script>
<script>
MapsGPX.onReady(function (){
  var $maps = document.getElementsByClassName('map'),
      apps = [], i, l, url;
  for ( i = 0, l = $maps.length; i < l; ++i ) {
    url = $maps.item(i).getAttribute('data-url');
    apps[i] = new MapsGPX($maps.item(i).getAttribute('id'));
    apps[i].input(url, url).then((function(key) {
      this.fitBounds(key);
      this.showOverlayWpts(key);
      this.showOverlayTrks(key);
    }).bind(apps[i]));
  }
});
</script>
</head><body>

  <h1>Japan National Route 1</h1>
  <div class="map" id="R1" data-url="R1.gpx"></div>

  <h1>Walking The Lake Biwa Canal</h1>
  <div class="map" id="sosui" data-url="Biwakososui.gpx"></div>

</body></html>
```

# API reference

Because maps.gpx is under development, API will be changed without notice.


## MapsGPX class

The core in this library.


### Class property

The global setting which has an influence on the inner movement.
It's desirable to set the value before processing.

property       | type    | description
---------------|---------|------------

join_trkseg    | boolean | Merge all trkseg in a "trk", one polyline per one "trk". Default is `true`
basedir        | String  | The directory this library is placed (read only)
plugin_dir     | String  | The directory the plugins are placed. It is `plugins` under the `basedir`


### Class Methods

These are general utilities.

The argument `src:Object` is a URL string or an instance of Blob for GPX.

require_plugins( PluginName:String [, PluginName:String, ...] ) | Promise | Create Promise which will resolve the end of load of the all listed plugins. All are load in sequence.
onReady( callback:Function ) | undefined | Register a *callback* function that will call when `MapsGPX` became available. After a load of a source of all plug-in has been completed, *callback* is called.

Note:

Each `createOverlayAs...` methods will return an overlay.
If wptType is Hash then it returns Maker,
or wptType is Array then it returns Polyline.

Because a marker and the polyline have the same interface as the overlay,
`MapsGPX` is designed to create overlay
without distinction about which is Marker or Polyline.

To make that possible, when creating Marker or Polyline for handling by `MapsGPX`,
you have to use these factory methods
and do not use constructor of `google.maps.Marker` and `google.maps.Polyline`


### Constructor

constructor | description
------------|------------
MapsGPX( map_id:String, map_option?:Hash, app_option?:Hash ) | Arguments are same as constructor of `google.maps.Map`. Please see its document for details

applyHook( hook:String, arguments )        | this | Apply all functions registered specified *hook* point as method of the instance `this`. *arguments* are different every hook point


### Hook

Several hook points are in the program.
You can register callbacks to each hooks by the method `register`.

Registered callbacks are executed as instance method.

It's possible to register more than one callbacks with one hooks.
In that case, callback will be executed in order of registration.

hook name             | description
----------------------|------------
onCreateLatlngbounds  | Apply hooks when `MapsGPX.LatLngBounds` is created. The callback will accept created object
onCreateMarker        | Apply hooks when `MapsGPX.Marker` is created. The callback will accept created object
onCreatePolyline      | Apply hooks when `MapsGPX.Polyline` is created. The callback will accept created object
onAddGPX              | Apply hooks when added GPX by `addGPX(key, src)`. The callback will accept the 1st argument *key* that will able to identify added GPX

Also there are hook points made by some plug-ins.

---

## Plug-in

There is mechanism of a plug-in in class `MapsGPX`.
It is usually provided in a different JavaScript source.

To use a plugin, declare it.

```
app.use('PluginName');
```

Please refer to each plug-in for details.

### Core plug-in

These plug-in are included inside the core library.

Even if you do not `use`, these plug-ins used by default effect.

#### MapsGPX.plugin.SetTitleOnCreateMarker

When a mouse pointer over a marker,
it shows the value of `name` in an element (usually waypoint) as a tool tips.

#### MapsGPX.plugin.SetStrokeOptionOnCreatePolyline

It defines options of polyline in the route and the track.
Concretely, it's about color, width and opacity.


## MapsGPX.plugin object specification

When you make a plug-in, please conform to this specification and MapsGPX.plugin.*PluginName* object specification.

All plug-ins have to be placed in the same directory.

Each plug-in makes its name the camel case which starts with a capital letter.
And create plugin script as `loader.js` in sub direcroty is named *PluginName*.

`MapsGPX` will register *PluginName* as a property in this namespace.

The name of property which starts with lowercase has been reserved.


## MapsGPX.plugin.*PluginName* object specification

There are reserved properties inside the namespace for the plug-in registered as *PluginName*.
When setting some value in these properties, the plug-in is sometimes affected by the outside.

Essentially, this is the interface to make a plug-in.

### Property

property   | type     | description
-----------|----------|------------
path       | string   | Used to resolve the base path of this plug-in. It is can be set by the instance method `require_plugin` of `MapsGPX`
callback   | Function | When registering this plug-in with an instance of `MapsGPX`, callback will be called at timing of the hook point set by property *hook*. If *hook* is false value, it will be called at just `use`. *callback* is called as the instance method of the `MapsGPX`, and its arguments are different depending on hooks.
hook       | String | specify the *hook* point to register the callback

A plug-in declares with each instance of `MapsGPX` basically (A plug-in shared by all instances is also possible.)

When each plug-in would like to maintain data in an instance, it's possible to use the "context" an instance has.

There is `this.context` in a property as a hash for a context. Please access the key with a plug-in name.

For example, a plug-in `VertexInfoWindow`, its *data* should be set in a context as follows.


```
this.context['VertexInfoWindow'] = data;
```
